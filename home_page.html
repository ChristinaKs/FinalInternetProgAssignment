            <h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
            <p>Valorant is a free-to-play, first-person shooter game developped by Riot Games. It is a 5v5 character-based 
               tactical game where precise gunplay meets unique character (agents) abilities. You get to choose a unique 
               agent that is armed with adaptive and creative abilities that create opportunities to let your gunplay shine. 
               No two agents are similar, and they have different abilities: some will heal, some will cause damage and others 
               will be informational. Multiple maps showcasing different parts of the world are available to play on. They are 
               each unique and allow for different types of gameplay, strategies and clutch moments. <br><br>
            </p>
               <p>It was first teased to the public under a different "name, Project A", in October 2019. Its official release 
                  was on June 2nd of 2020. The gameplay will vary pending on the gamemode you will play. Unrated is a non-ranked 
                  mode where the attacking team will attempt to plant a spike, bomb, and the defending team must prevent that 
                  from happening. After twelve rounds, the teams will switch sides and, the first team to thirteen points win 
                  the game. Competitive is a gamemode that plays exactly like unrated, but it is a ranked gamemode. Spike rush 
                  is played as best-of-seven rounds and all players begin the game with all of their abilities as well as the 
                  same guns, which are randomized. The Deathmatch mode is a free-for-all mode between fourteen players. The first 
                  player to forty kills wins the game or, the player with the most kills after nine minutes will win. Escalation 
                  Escalation is a gungame mode which will change everyone on the team's gun after a certain amount of kills and, 
                  the first team to win the game is the one who gets through all twelve levels of guns. Finally, Replication is a 
                  gamemode where evereyone votes on an agent in the selection phase and, at random, an agent is randomly selected. 
                  Players will have a set amount of money to buy guns and shields between each round and everyone spawns with all 
                  of their abilities. This gamemode is a best-of-nine. <br><br>

               This bundle is one of many examples of skin sets that a player may buy in this game. A skin set is a set of

               this are the main colour of the skin, the animations, such as reloading and shooting, and the finisher
