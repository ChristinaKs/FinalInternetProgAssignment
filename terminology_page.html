         <h2>Map: Bind</h2>
         Bind is a two site map where attackers are infiltrating from a beach coast. This map has 
         two sites and no middle: a side, left or right, must be picked. Instead of having a middle, 
         the sites are binded together through two one-way teleporters which allow players to quickly 
         rotate or flank the enemy team. This map is inspired but the coordinates  at 34°2'A" N 6°51'Z" 
         W, off the coast of Rabat, Morocco. The lore of this map revolve around being Cypher, one of 
         the agents' home.

         <h2>Map: Ascent</h2>
         Ascent was the first map added since Valorant's official release. It is a two-site map with 
         the most open areas and a large courtyard in the center of the map. This courtyard is a quick 
         shortcut between sights, but is risky as it does not offer much cover. This map has closeable 
         doors, which was the first of its kind to enter the game. This map is based off of the 
         coordinates at 45°26'BF" N 12°20'Q" E in San Marco, Venice, Italy and contains many landmarks 
         from the area.

         <h2>Map: Icebox</h2>
         Icebox is a map that takes place in a tunfra climate. It is one of the most complicated maps as 
         it has many angles and cornerers as well as verticality to cover. It is a two-site map with a 
         two-tier middle. This map is great for certain agents such as Raze, Jett and Omen who are able to 
         reach the high ground. It is based off of the coordinates  at 76°44'A" N 149°30'Z" E, off the coast 
         of Bennett Island, Sakha, Russia. THe lore behind this map lies within the stolen mask behind the 
         shattered glass in the A site, which is used in agent Yoru's ultimate. It is believed that Yoru 
         carried out the break-in.

         <h2>Map: Haven</h2>
         Haven is unique because it is the only map with three bomb sites. One site is meant for long range 
         combat while another is tighter quarters and will engage in close combat. This map is inspired by 
         the coordinates at 27°28'A" N 89°38'WZ" E, in Thimphu, Bhutan.

         <h2>Map: Breeze</h2>
         Breeze is a map that has a tropical island setting and is one of the largest maps in size. It 
         is a two site map with a large, open middle. It features two tiers in certain places and 
         is based on the coordinates at 26°11'AG" N 71°10'WY" W, off the coast of the Bahamas, in 
         the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantic Ocean. It is the lore of this map that agent KAY/O 
         arrived on earth through the teleporter on this map as it was abandonned and inactive and had 
         a sign on it saying "sequence initiated", which is one of the agent's voicelines.

      <div id="split2">
         <h2>Map: Split</h2>
         Split is a map that is named the way it is because the left side of the map is split from the 
         right side through how poor it is. This map will show dirt roads and half destroyed houses on 
         the left-hand side, and on the right-hand side you will find billboards, fancy homes and offices, 
         etc. The map is literally split in a war of poor v rich. This map has two sites and a middle 
         area that provides high ground dominance. This map is inspired by the coordinates at  35°41'CD" 
         N 139°41'WX" E, in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.

         <h2>Map: Fracture</h2>
         Fracture is a top-secret experiment site split apart by a radianite-fueled disaster. In its 
         simplest form, the map is marked by its H-shape layout with a visual split down the middle that 
         reveals contrasting sides. Long ziplines also connect routes underneath. This map has heavy and 
         interactive lore tied to it and is based on the coordinates at 35°48'BI" N 106°08'YQ" W, in Santa 
         Fe, New Mexico, USA.
