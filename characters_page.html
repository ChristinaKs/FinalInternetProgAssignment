      <h1>The Importance of Knowing Your Characters</h1>
      <p>Knowing your characters, their abilities and how they are best used might make the difference between being 
         an okay player and being a good player. Different characters will be separated into different classes which 
         each indicate they type of abilities an agent may have. These classes are Duelists, Controllers, Initiators 
         and Sentinels. A well-rounded team will have one of at least each of these classes as they will have a 
         team composition that will allow for good offense and defense. This Page will offer up more detailed 
         information about the base characters that come free with the game. <br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>Agent Classes</h3>
      <p>The Duelist class is the most aggressive class as it offers agents that create the most impact and inflict the 
         most damage with their abilities. These players should be seeking engagement with the opposing team. The agents 
         within this class are Jett, Phoenix, Raze, Reyna and Yoru.<br><br> Controllers are the ones who will slice up the map, 
         usually with  smokes. These agents will essentially block off a target's vision and ultimately slow them down. 
         The agents in the Controller class are Astra, Omen, Brimstone and Viper.<br><br> Initiators will set their team up to 
         entry sites by pushing defenders away, usually by blinding them, revealing the enemies' location or stunning the 
         enemies. The initiators are Breach, KAY/O, Skye and Sova.<br><br> Finally, Sentinels are defensive experts who will 
         lock down areas who will put a stop to or considerably slow down a push from the enemies. Chamber, Cypher, Killjoy 
         and Sage are the agents that are in this class.
